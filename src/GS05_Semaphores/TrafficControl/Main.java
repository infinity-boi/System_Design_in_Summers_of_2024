package GS05_Semaphores.TrafficControl;

/*
Problem Statement:
 Implement a program that simulaties traffic intersection control system
 using java semaphores, the intersection has 2 road each with its
 traffic signal. Only one road should have green light at time while
 the other road has red light.
 The interesection should allow smooth transition
 between green lights for both the roads.
 Requirements
 the duration of each R,Y, G can be adjusted by the user
 Each road signal should run in separate thread
 Sample Output
 Road A: Green, Road B : Red
 ...sometime after ...
 Road A: Yellow, Road B: Red
 Road A : Red, Road : Green
